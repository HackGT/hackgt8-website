        HackGT is a free 36-hour hackathon where students from across the
        world come together for a weekend to create innovative projects that
        show off their creativity and passion for development. You may choose
        any platform, programming language, or format to show how you build
        solutions.
      </p>

        Participating in this event will widen your professional network and
        allow you to further develop your creativity! With tech talks and
        workshops, you will have the opportunity to talk to and learn from
        professionals in various industries. We encourage everyone to be a

          <h3>Emerging</h3>
          <p>
            New to hackathons and unsure of how to get started building a
            technology project? The Emerging Hacker Track is here to provide
            you with guidance into introductory technology and how to ace a
            hackathon. Back by popular demand, this track will feature mentor
            matching to help guide you and your team through your first
            hackathon project. We will also be offering a wide and flexible
            variety of workshops ranging from web development and data science
            to design and computing systems designed just for you to learn the
            fundamentals and get you started on your dream hackathon project!
          </p>
          <p>Our Learning Paths for Emerging hackers this year are:</p>
          <h4>App Dev:</h4>
          <p>The App Dev Learning Path covers Android, iOS, and web development; you can choose as many of the options
            as you’d like! You will be introduced to the basics of Android app development using Android Studio or iOS
            development to build native mobile apps. We will also step through the entire process of creating a simple
            full-stack web application using JavaScript. Soon, you will be able to not only show off your technical
            skills but also publish your accomplishments online, on the Google Play store or your very own website!
          </p>
          <h4>Data Science:</h4>
          <p>
            Whether you’re interested in machine learning algorithms or data analytics and visualization, the
            data science learning path will expose students to the process of collecting, cleaning, and analyzing large
            sets of data!
          </p>
          <h4>
            Design:
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Design Learning Path will teach you the fundamentals of user interface/user
            experience (UI/UX) design from user research to creating beautiful mockups and prototypes. Gain skills and
            knowledge vital to the product development process and apply them to create effective user-centered apps and
            websites! Systems: In the Systems Learning Path, we will be going over the basics of systems development.
            Specifically, we’ll be exploring robotics and developing embedded systems using Arduinos to create
            innovative projects that combine software and hardware!</p>

          For our in-person participants, we will provide hardware through our
          hardware desk! For virtual participants, we will, unfortunately, be
          unable to provide hardware; instead, we are offering hardware
          reimbursements! Fill out the Hardware Reimbursement Form (available
          after your event registration is confirmed) to get up to $75
          reimbursed after HackGT 8! You must have a valid submission to
          devpost and receipts of your purchases to be reimbursed.

          If you are virtual, all you'll need is a computer with an Internet

          laptop, charger, headphones, and anything else you'll need over the
          weekend. We'll provide hardware, meals, and snacks.

          In general, no — true to the spirit of hackathons, you may not
          submit your past projects to HackGT. If you are a General Hacker,
          you can submit an open-source contribution to our Open Source prize;
          this can be any open-source project, including your own! See the

          Given the hybrid nature of HackGT 8, we are very flexible with forming teams. You are free to form teams
          between virtual and in-person participants, and you can also have a mix of Emerging and General participants
          within a team! Note that a team must be entirely Emerging participants to be eligible for Emerging-specific
          prizes.

      <h2>Regarding COVID-19</h2>
      <p>
        Our thoughts are with those who have been affected by the coronavirus
        pandemic. For HackGT 8, we are actively monitoring and assessing how
        our organization can best ensure the safety of our participants and
        our team, given the dangerous nature of the virus. Even with
        nationwide rollouts of the vaccine, we still want to exercise caution.
        Currently, the Georgia Institute of Technology is planning to return
        to normal on-campus operations for the fall semester should guidance
        from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia
        Department of Public Health allow it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, we are planning for a hybrid event format to account for
        the uncertainty. Over the past year, we have gained an immense amount
        of experience in coordinating virtual events and are prepared to build
        on those insights again. We hope to combine our long history of
        in-person hackathons with our virtual experience to once again throw
        an incredible event. As the situation progresses we may alter our plan
        to accommodate more in-person experiences or rely more on virtual
        mechanisms. In any case, we will work diligently to create the best
        hacking environment for our participants. Thank you for your support
        and understanding.

        Dear Hacker,<br /><br />

        You may know that recently, the HackGTeam established an umbrella
        organization: HexLabs. We're still the same organization you know and
        love - we want to provide opportunities to create, collaborate, and
        learn for ourselves. For this reason, HexLabs aims to create spaces to
        not only provide the resources but also to build a community of
        creatives, techies, and innovators to support one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to achieve this, we've decided to host a hybrid event this
        year. Georgia Tech students will have the opportunity to attend our
        in-person event, and we are excited to host the event virtually for
        non-GT students. We hope that this will make our event safer and more
        accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our community is not possible without you and your enthusiasm, so
        thank you for being a part of our journey. Whether you've been here
        since the beginning or are just getting to know our org, we are
        looking forward to having you at HackGT 8 to Discover Your Craft.<br /><br />

        With love,<br />
        HexLabs
