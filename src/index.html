          Dear Hacker,<br /><br />

          You may know that recently, the HackGTeam established an umbrella
          organization: HexLabs. We're still the same organization you know and
          love - we want to provide opportunities to create, collaborate, and
          learn for ourselves. For this reason, HexLabs aims to create spaces to
          not only provide the resources but also to build a community of
          creatives, techies, and innovators to support one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to achieve this, we've decided to host a hybrid event this
          year. Georgia Tech students will have the opportunity to attend our
          in-person event, and we are excited to host the event virtually for
          non-GT students. We hope that this will make our event safer and more
          accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our community is not possible without you and your enthusiasm, so
          thank you for being a part of our journey. Whether you've been here
          since the beginning or are just getting to know our org, we are
          looking forward to having you at HackGT 8 to Discover Your Craft.<br /><br />

          With love,<br />
          HexLabs
